## Pull Request Reviews and Feedback

When acting on or updating a Pull Request, you must actively parse and address all inline review comments. 

* **Check for Inline Comments:** Do not rely solely on the main PR description or direct `@jules` mentions. Actively scan for `pull_request_review_comment` events on specific lines of code.
* **Incorporate Feedback:** Treat all inline comments as direct instructions. Incorporate the requested changes into your planning phase and execute the necessary code updates before requesting a re-review.
